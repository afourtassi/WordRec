        This is an experiment that tests aspects of human word learning. The experiment involves audio sequences. Please make sure that no music is played in the background. Put your headphones on or make sure you are in a quiet environment. <br><br> The experiment takes less than 10 minutes in total! <br><br> Warning: if you are using Internet Explorer, some aspects of the experiment might not function properly!

    This first part of the experiment serves as a training for the task that you will perform later. Please take enough time to read and understand the following instructions. <br><br> An alien will be naming to his friend two objects from the planet Earth: a <span class="f_o">{{}}</span> and a <span class="s_o">{{}}</span>. The alien will not be speaking in English, but in an alien language. In this language, a <span class="f_o">{{}}</span> is called '<span class="f_w">{{}}</span>' and a <span class="s_o">{{}}</span> is called '<span class="s_w">{{}}</span>'. <br><br> In each situation, the alien will be naming two objects: the first object will show on the left, and will always be a <span class="f_o">{{}}</span> (<span class="f_w">{{}}</span>). The second object will show on the right and will be either another <span class="f_o">{{}}</span> (<span class="f_w">{{}}</span>), or a <span class="s_o">{{}}</span> (<span class="s_w">{{}}</span>).<br><br> Your task is to help the other alien decide. You should press <span class="same-key">{{}}</span> (for same) if you think that the first alien is naming two <span class="f_o">{{}}</span>s, and <span class="different-key">{{}}</span> (for different) if you think he is naming a <span class="f_o">{{}}</span> and a <span class="s_o">{{}}</span><br><br>

  <br>

    <p id="instructions2" class="block-text">Now you will start the real experiment. Please take enough time to read and understand the following instructions. Your perfromance  should reflect this understanding:<br><br> Similar to the training, the first word will always involve the same <span class="f_o">{{}}</span> and the same name <span class="f_w">{{}}</span>, however the second word will now bring two difficuties: <br><br>
    1) The first difficulty is that there will be slight differences in the pronounciation, and it can sometimes be hard to distinguish <span class="f_w">{{}}</span> from <span class="s_w">{{}}</span>. <br><br>
    2) The second difficulty is that <span class="s_o">{{}}</span>s and <span class="f_o">{{}}</span>s now come in similar shapes, and it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish the picture of a <span class="s_o">{{}}</span> from the picture of a <span class="f_o">{{}}</span>.<br><br> Click continue for instructions on how to overcome these difficulties! </p>

<!-- Include the <a href="experiment.html">JavaScript file for the experiment</a>. As written, that script immediately executes commands, so we include it here at the end of the HTML file to ensure that resources referenced by the script actually exist. For instance, one of the immediately executed commands is <code>showSlide("instructions")</code>. If we loaded experiment.js, say, in the <code>head</code> section, <code>showSlide("instructions")</code> would fail because the <code>instructions</code> slide doesn't exist yet. It is possible to load the script in <code>head</code> but you have to ensure that any immediately executed commands, if they rely on potentially uninitialized HTML elements, are _delayed_ until the page is ready, using either [window.onload][onload] or jQuery's more robust [$(document).ready()][domReady]  -->
